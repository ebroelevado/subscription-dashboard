  TDD loop. RED-GREEN-REFACTOR until coverage
  target met.
---

## Activate When
- `/godmode:test`, "write tests", "test coverage"

## The Loop
```bash
# Measure current coverage
npx vitest --coverage 2>&1 | tail -5
# Or: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term | grep TOTAL
# Or: go test -cover ./...
```
```
coverage = measure_coverage()
target = user_target OR 80
current_iteration = 0

WHILE coverage < target:
    current_iteration += 1
    # 1. FIND — coverage report, untested lines
    #    Priority: happy > error > edge > integration
    # 2. RED — write ONE test. It MUST fail.
    #    IF passes immediately: wrong test, delete
    # 3. GREEN — write minimum code -> PASS
    # 4. REFACTOR — remove test duplication
    #    Run ALL tests. IF unrelated breaks -> revert
    # 5. COMMIT: git add {file} && git commit
    # 6. MEASURE: coverage = measure_coverage()
    # 7. LOG to .godmode/test-results.tsv
    IF current_iteration % 5 == 0:
        print "Iter {N}: {coverage}% (target: {target}%)"

Print: "Coverage: {start}% -> {final}% in {N} iters"
```

<!-- tier-3 -->

## Quality Targets
- Coverage target: >=80% line coverage (configurable)
- Test execution: <30s for unit suite, <120s for integration
- Flaky tests: 0 tolerated (quarantine immediately)
- Test-to-code ratio: >=1.5 test lines per code line
- Max test file size: <300 lines (split if larger)
- Assertion density: >=2 assertions per test average

## Output Format
Print: `Test: coverage {start}% -> {final}% (target: {target}%). {N} tests added in {iters} iterations.
Status: {DONE|PARTIAL}.`

## Workflow Detail
1. **Detect framework**: read package.json, pytest.ini, Cargo.toml, go.mod to find test runner.
2. **Baseline coverage**: run coverage command, parse report, record starting percentage.
3. **Identify gaps**: read coverage report line-by-line, list uncovered functions sorted by importance.
4. **RED**: write one failing test targeting the highest-priority uncovered path.
5. **GREEN**: write minimum production code (or confirm existing code) to make the test pass.
6. **REFACTOR**: clean up duplication in test and source, re-run full suite to confirm no regressions.
7. **COMMIT**: stage test file and any changed source, commit with message `test: cover {function/path}`.
8. **MEASURE**: re-run coverage, compute delta, log to TSV.
9. **REPEAT**: go to step 3 until coverage target met or stop condition triggers.
10. **FINAL REPORT**: print summary with start coverage, final coverage, iterations, tests added, and status.

## Hard Rules
0. **Inherits Default Activations per `SKILL.md §14`.** Principles prelude, pre-commit audit (agents/tester.md step 11a), terse/stdio/tokens, DispatchContext validation, Progressive Disclosure routing, discard cost hierarchy all fire by default.
1. RED first -- test must fail before implementation.
   If passes immediately: wrong test, delete.
2. One test per iteration -- atomic, revertable.
3. No mocking unless external I/O (network, fs, clock).
   Test names: `should_{verb}_when_{condition}`.
4. Min 1 assertion per test; 3+ recommended.
5. Priority: happy_path > error_path > edge_case.
6. Never keep a test that does not increase coverage.
7. Never ask to continue. Loop autonomously.

## Keep/Discard Discipline
```
KEEP if: coverage increased AND all existing tests pass
DISCARD if: coverage unchanged OR existing test broke
  On discard: git reset --hard HEAD~1
  Log reason. Move to next uncovered path.
```

### Overfitting Prevention
Tests must cover behavior, not implementation. If a test breaks when internals change but behavior is preserved → test is overfitted. Rewrite it.

## Stop Conditions
```
STOP when FIRST of:
  - coverage >= target (default 80%)
  - 50 iterations reached (safety limit)
  - 3 consecutive iterations with <0.5% gain
  - >5 consecutive discards on different paths
```

## Error Recovery
| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Test passes immediately | Delete. Rewrite to test specific uncovered behavior. |
| Coverage unchanged | Check coverage report line-by-line. May hit covered paths. |
| Unrelated test breaks | Revert. Check shared state or import side effects. Fix isolation. |
| Coverage plateaus | Switch to integration tests. Check for dead code inflating denominator. |

## TSV Logging
Append to `.godmode/test-results.tsv`:
`iteration\ttest_file\tlines_covered\tcoverage_before\tcoverage_after\tdelta\tstatus`
Status: kept, discarded, plateau.
